## Description
This application allows users to input notes or tasks they would like to track by clicking "Get Started" on the landing page. It will direct users to a secondary note.html page that will store old notes, create new notes using a submit button, cancel a current note by using a clear button, and deleted notes saved on the left side of the application by pressing the trash can icon.
